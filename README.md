👋 Hi, I’m Ziad

Electrical & Electronics Engineer | Embedded Systems Developer | Robotics & Hardware Creator

I design and build practical electronic systems — from custom PCBs to full embedded solutions. My goal is to create machines, tools, and robotics that solve real problems. I enjoy working across the entire stack: hardware design, firmware development, and system-level software.

🔧 What I Do
Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers

Design and program with ESP32, AVR, ARM-based MCUs

Develop firmware in C, C++, MicroPython

Work with real-time constraints, sensors, actuators, and communication protocols
(UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, WiFi, BLE)

Electronics & Hardware Design

Custom PCB design using KiCad / Altium / EasyEDA

Analog and digital circuit design

Hardware debugging with multimeters, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers

Software & Scripting

Python for automation, tooling, and data processing

Linux development (Arch, Kali), shell scripting, tool creation

Comfortable building CLI tools and small utilities

Robotics & Machines

Prototype robotic systems

Motor drivers, power systems, sensor integration

Building tools and devices to reduce dependency on commercial hardware

🚀 What I’m Working On

Designing my own embedded tools so I don't rely on commercial products

Building reusable libraries and hardware modules for robotics

Creating security and automation tools on Linux for engineering workflows

Expanding my knowledge in real-time operating systems and low-level development
